        <p>Ella had never stepped foot into a mansion before. The moment she walked in, the air felt different — colder, more formal, and yet… exciting. Today was the day she would meet Adrian Cole, the billionaire she would serve.</p>
        <p>Her heart raced as she adjusted her maid uniform. Little did she know, Adrian had his own plans — and they weren’t exactly about cleaning.</p>
